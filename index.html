    <h3><img src="Images/Profile cat.jpg" width="100px"> Hello!!</h3>
        <p><em><strong>I am still very much in love with the idea of marketing and advertising.</strong></em></p>
        <p><em>I was thrilled with the arrival of digital and love how every day there is 'newness' that is bringing in awesome ideas and fabulous executions! <strong>Lets get to know me a bit more and exactly how i became a part of the 'marketing world'!</strong></em></p>

    <h3> How it all began and what i learn't as a marketing intern? <img src="https://previews.123rf.com/images/worldofvector/worldofvector1708/worldofvector170800202/84364785-white-cat-wearing-sunglasses-eyeglasses-black-lenses-cute-cartoon-funny-character-kitten-in.jpg" width="100px"></h3>
    <p><em>I started my career in marketing as an intern and an executive where i learnt about <strong>Product marketing, showcasing ideas to stakeholders, creating small adverts and promoting them through offline channels and internal newsletters.</strong> It was fun doing this in those days, obviously the world was still exploring how digitisation could be used to its fullest and we had just heard of soemthing like <strong>"Digital Marketing"</strong>. I jumped from events departments to merchandise to publications to overall product management. This marked the beginning of my project management role.</em></p>

    <p><em>I later went onto to work with two popular companies a risk management consultancy and an oil and gas company. This marked the starting point of my career and learnings within the B2B marketing world. Its difficult, its not straight forward - i had to work hard and learnt how <strong>social media, stakeholders, campaigns and segments are managed within global marketing departments</strong>. Yes, the digital world had hit in and we had social communications flying all over the world. My career had seen new growth and i was now a senior marketing executive.<em></p>

    <p><em>The phase came where i really wanted to learn more. My company was progressing towards <strong>digital account based marketing</strong>. By now i had <strong>11 years of marketing experince and tremendous knowledge of B2B marketing campaigns</strong>. 2019 i joined one of the best finanacial companies and i was promoted at an officer level. 2022, i took admission in University of Surrey to study Digital marketing. Becoming a student again after 12 years - was the best feeling ever. The course is ongoing and so is my job. <strong>I now handle high level thought leadership campaigns across various channels within which my company promotes its deliverables and i help project manage with my experince put together with all the learnings i am getting from Surrey Business School.</strong></em></p>
